![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/huhwt/huhwt-clippings_cart_enhanced)

This [webtrees](https://www.webtrees.net/) custom module replaces the original 'Clippings Cart' module.
It offers additional possibilities to add records to the clippings cart and owns beside the possibility
to export GEDCOM information for visualizing the records in the clippings cart using a diagram.

This custom module is mainly a backport of the hh_clippings_cart_enhanced by Hermann Hartenthaler
(https://github.com/hartenthaler/hh_clippings_cart_enhanced) which was developed for upcoming
webtrees-2.1. Since it is not foreseeable when webtrees-2.1 will be ready for productive use, 
and because of the special qualities of the module, it seemed to make sense to me to transfer it
back to webtrees-2.0.

For features and background of this module please have a look at the above given link.

## Description

An action initiated by the user then takes place on the records in the clippings cart, such as
* the export to a GEDCOM zip file, as in the actual clippings cart module
* the display of the objects in list form with the possibility of sorting and filtering this list (tbd)
* the transfer of the records in the clippings cart to new functions that visualize this data or analyze it statistically.
Such a function could be for example a link-node-diagram like
[TAM](https://github.com/huhwt/huhwt-wttam) (Topographic Attribute Map) or [Lineage](https://github.com/huhwt/lineage).
