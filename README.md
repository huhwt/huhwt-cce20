This [webtrees](https://www.webtrees.net/) custom module replaces the original 'Clippings Cart' module.
It offers additional possibilities to add records to the clippings cart and owns beside the possibility
to export GEDCOM information for visualizing the records in the clippings cart using a diagram.

This custom module is mainly a backport of the hh_clippings_cart_enhanced by Hermann Hartenthaler
(https://github.com/hartenthaler/hh_clippings_cart_enhanced) which was developed for upcoming
webtrees-2.1. Since it is not foreseeable when webtrees-2.1 will be ready for productive use, 
and because of the special qualities of the module, it seemed to make sense to me to transfer it
back to webtrees-2.0.

For features and background of this module please have a look at the above given link.

All features of the original version have been taken over. Own additions extend the management of the records collected in the cart by targeted deletion of entire subgroups and in the display panel the ability to fold and unfold subgroups by clicking on the group heading.

A special feature is the option to export selected records not only in Gedcom format - zipped or plain text - but also to pass them directly to visualization tools. Currently the direct connection of TAM is implemented, further tools will follow.

TAM stands for 'Topographic Attribute Maps' and is a node-link diagram underlaid with a contour line-like representation of temporal references. The tool was developed at the University of Graz, you can find a demo at https://github.com/rpreiner/tam, its background is documented here: https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.1111/cgf13987.

The tool can be found at https://github.com/huhwt/huhwt-wttam. It has to be installed separately in Webtrees.

## Description

An action initiated by the user then takes place on the records in the clippings cart, such as
* the export to a GEDCOM zip file, as in the actual clippings cart module
* the display of the objects in list form with the possibility of sorting and filtering this list (tbd)
* the transfer of the records in the clippings cart to new functions that visualize this data or analyze it statistically.
Such a function could be for example a link-node-diagram like
[TAM](https://github.com/huhwt/huhwt-wttam) (Topographic Attribute Map) or [Lineage](https://github.com/huhwt/lineage).
